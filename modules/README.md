# React Native - Native Modules

Native modules, written in Kotlin and Swift, to be used from the React Native front-end are defined here.

See the [Expo Modules docs](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/) to create expo modules.

The first module to be created will be cairo-m, to use the Cairo M project, initially written in Rust, with Kotlin and Swift bindings generated with UniFFI.
